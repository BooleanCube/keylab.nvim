<p>
keylab.nvim aims to aid new neovim users to boost their productivity by practicing their keybinding configurations multiple times. When used enough times, improvements in typing ability are noticeable.
</p>
<p>
keylab.nvim also serves as a plugin to measure the user's coding speed. Similar to <code>https://www.speedtyper.dev/ (by codicocodes)</code>, except this has custom scripts and your personal vim configuration as possible options. Measure your true coding speed on neovim and aim for even higher results. All languages supported by your neovim configuration, are also supported.
</p>

### Example

### Suggestions
<p>
To use keylab.nvim effectively, I would suggest 3-5 coding sessions everyday before you get into work. Try to beat your past session in every session you play. In less than a week's time, you will realise how much you have improved over a short time period.
</p>
<p>
My biggest improvements were: being able to locate and press weird keys (like ">(#{") without having to look at your keyboard. I also saw a decent increase in accuracy which means I don't mess up on weird keys that often anymore.
